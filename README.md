# Pokemon Game Challenge Based on Graph Theory Algorithms
### About:
- This project was built as part of the Java OOP Course of the Computer Science Department at Ariel University 2020.

- This project consists of two part:
  - **Part 1:** Contains an implementation of a directed (positive) weighted graph data structure and algorithms (located inside the **api** package).
  - **Part 2:** Contains an implementation of the game, the game logic and the graphical user interface (located inside the **gameClient** package).
- **Project contributors**: Evgueni Lachtchenov

### To try this game:
Before running this game make sure that you have JDK version 11 or older installed on you machine.
And then follow the instructions below:  
1) Download the Ex2.jar file included at project's root folder.
2) Also, make sure to download the data folder and the res folder from the root of this project.
3) Put together **Ex2.jar** file, **data** and **res** folders inside a new folder.
4) Open CMD or Terminal and navigate to the folder in which the files mentioned above are located.
5) Type the following command `java -jar Ex2.jar id scenario` where id represents your **id** (9 disits) and **secenario** represents the game level (a number between 0 - 23 inclusive).
6) For example, the command below will start the game with id 123456789 and in the secenario number 12:
    - `java -jar Ex2.jar 123456789 12`
7) Another way of executing the `Jar` file in this project, is to double click on it and then selecting the id, and level from the GUI.
