# Pokemon Game Based on Graph Theory Algorithms

### Project Overview

- This project was built as part of the Java OOP Course of the Computer Science Department at Ariel University 2020.

- In this project you will find an implementation of a directed positive weighted graph data structure and algorithms.

- You'll also find an implementation of a Pokemon Game against a server.

- The game strategy is developed based on the Graph Theory algorithms.

- For more information please read the Wiki page of this game.

- **Project contributors**: Evgueni Lachtchenov

### Below you can a screenshot from one of the game's scenarios:
