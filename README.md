# Pokemon Game Challenge Based on Graph Theory Algorithms

- This project was built as part of the Java OOP Course of the Computer Science Department at Ariel University 2020.

- This project consists of two part:
  - Part 1: Contains an implementation of a directed (positive) weighted graph data structures and algorithms (located inside the **api** package).
  - Part 2: Contains an implementation of the game, the game logic and the graphical user interface (located inside the **gameClient** package).
  
### To try this game:
Before running this game make sure that you have JDK version 11 or older imstalled on you machine.
And then follow the unstructions below:  
1) Download the Ex2.jar included at project's root folder.
2) Make sure to download also the data folder and the res folder from the root of this project.
3) Put together Ex2.jar and the folders data and res at the same folder.
4) Make sure that you are running JDK 11 at least.
5) Execute the following command in CMD if you are running windows or in Terminal if you are running Linux or Mac:
  
    - `java -jar Ex2.jar 123456789 12`
    - Note: `123456789` represents your id (9 digits) and `12` represents the scenarion number.
